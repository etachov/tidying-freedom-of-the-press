# Tidying Update Freedom House's Freedom of the Press Data

This chunk of code downloads and reshapes Freedom House's <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/freedom-press-2015" target="_blank">Freedom of the Press</a> data to make it more useful for analysis. 

Here's a quick gif of the score distributions from 2001 to 2014 made with <a href="https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate" target="_blank">gganimate</a>. Note how the bimodal distribution has converged in recent years.
